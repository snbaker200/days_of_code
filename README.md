# 10 Days of Code: Topic Modeling on Student Survey Data

I had previously developed surveys with multiple choice and open-ended questions and had collected data from students. For my 10 Days of Code Data Science bootcamp project, I decided to develop a workflow to explore some of the open-ended responses using Natural Language Processing. I played around with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to do some topic modeling on my dataset. Ultimately, I chose to use NMF because it plays better with smaller datasets. After the camp, I used Bokeh to do some visual exploration. I'm a coding newbie, so there are a lot of notes for beginners.

I have uploaded my Jupyter Notebook which contains information about how I merged and de-identified my pre-existing data files.
I will upload my main project file soon.
